        <p>For the luck of we human beings, earth is a watery place. On earth, water exists
            in different forms like oceans, rivers, water vapours in the air, icecaps,
        glaciers, aquifers, and soil moisture. These are all the water resources
        of Earth. Approximately 71% of the earth&apos;s surface is covered with water,
        and 97% of all Earth's water is held by the ocean. Only 3% is held in by
         rivers, lakes, underground water, etc. Due to the water cycle, Earth&apos;s water
        supply is constantly moving from one place to another place and from one form to
        another form. In this article, we are discussing the availability of water on
         Earth and the availability of water resources.</p>

        <h2 style="text-align: center;">Current Water Status</h2>

        <p>The current water status on Earth is a complex and dynamic interplay of various factors,
            including availability, distribution, quality, and the impact of human activities on this 
            precious resource. Water is essential for life and plays a crucial role in sustaining
             ecosystems, supporting agriculture, and meeting the needs of a growing global population.
              Here, we will explore the multifaceted aspects of the current water status on Earth.</p>

        <p>India is facing one of its biggest challenges  the world&apos;s worst water crisis. India
         is at the epicenter of a global water and sanitation disaster. The problem at hand, has ballooned
         and now our lives, livelihoods and futures hang in balance.</p>
         <h3>some disturbing factors</h3>
         <ul>
            <li>More than 50% of the population has no access to safe drinking water.</li>
            <li>About 200,000 people die every year for lack of access to safe drinking water</li>
            <li>If we continue to consume water as per the current rate, India will have only half the water it needs by 2030.</li>
            <li>India draws nearly 25% of the world&apos;s groundwater - that&apos;s more groundwater than China and the USA combined.</li>
            <li>India&apos;s depleting groundwater reserves impact our drinking water – India is ranked 120 out of 122 countries in the global water quality index.</li>
            <li>India&apos;s water crisis has a significant economic cost – A NITI Aayog report suggests that severe water scarcity will lead to a six percent loss in the country&apos;s GDP.</li>
            <li>The National Institution for Transforming India (NITI Aayog) has described the current situation as the &apos;worst water crisis in India&apos;s history.</li>
            <li>Food supply is also at risk as lack of water supply will lead to poor crop yield.</li>
            <li>Over 75% of households do not have clean drinking water, while 40% of the population will have no access to drinking water by 2030.</li>
         </ul>
         <img src="OIP.jpg" alt="" style="border-radius: 15%;">
         <img src="scar.jpg" alt="" style="height: 22%; width:22%; border-radius: 15%;">

         <img src="download.jpg" alt="" style="height: 22%; width: 22%; border-radius: 15%;">
         <p>Unless India wakes up to its water crisis, disaster is looming. Water scarcity is one of the biggest problems the country is facing today and more than the scarcity of water, it remains an issue of management of water resources. NITI Aayog estimates that 21 major cities, including Delhi, would run out of groundwater by 2030.

            According to estimates, India has 16% of the world&apos;s population but only 4% of the world&apos;s freshwater resources. Despite significant investment and improvement in the water sector, it is becoming very difficult to manage the ever-increasing demand for water in India. If the status quo is not changed, India’s water problems would be further aggravated, as it is already a water-stressed country.</p>

        <h2 style="text-align: center;">What is Water Conservation</h2>
        <p>Water conservation is the practice of using water efficiently to reduce unnecessary water usage. According to Fresh Water Watch, water conservation is important because fresh clean water is a limited resource, as well as a costly one. As a homeowner, you&apos;re probably already well aware of the financial costs of inefficient water use. Conservation of this natural resource is critical for the environment — and our wallets.</p>

        <h3>How to save water: 10 tips for saving water around the home</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Put a brick in your toilet&apos;s water tank.</b> You flush an average of 20 gallons of water a day down the toilet. If you don’t have a high-efficiency toilet, try filling your tank with something that will displace some of that water, such as a brick.</li>
            <li><b>Use the right amount of water for each load of laundry.</b> Typically 15-40 percent of indoor home water use comes from doing laundry. Save water by making sure to adjust the settings on your machine to the proper load size.</li>
            <li><b>Pick your washing machine wisely.</b> When considering top-load vs. front-load washers, front-loading washing machines generally use less water.</li>
            <li><b>Water plants wisely.</b> Water your lawn or garden early in the morning or late in the evening, so the water lasts and is not immediately evaporated by the hot sun.</li>
            <li><b>Install a low-flow showerhead.</b> With a low-flow showerhead, you can save 15 gallons of water during a 10-minute shower.</li>
            <li><b>Check for and repair leaks.</b> An average of 10,000 gallons of water is wasted every year due to household leaks. One of the most effective ways to cut your water footprint is to repair leaky faucets and toilets.</li>
            <li><b>Use a dishwasher.</b> Dishwashing accounts for less than 2 percent of indoor water use, but using a machine is actually more water efficient than hand washing, especially if you run full loads. ENERGY STAR® dishwashers save about 1,600 gallons of water over its lifetime of use.</li>
            <li><b>Turn off the water.</b> Teach your whole household to turn off the faucet while brushing teeth or shaving. Every little bit of water conservation helps!</li>
            <li><b>Defrost food in the fridge.</b> Instead of running frozen foods under hot water from the faucet, build in time to let them defrost in the refrigerator.</li>
            <li><b>Manage outdoor water use.</b> Don't forget about water conservation outside as well. Equip all hoses with shut-off nozzles, which can prevent hose leaks.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Acts related to water conservation</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>1882</strong> - The Easement Act allows private rights to use a resource that is, groundwater, by viewing it as an attachment to the land. It also states that all surface water belongs to the state and is a state property.</li>
            <li><strong>1897</strong> - The Indian Fisheries Act establishes two sets of penal offences whereby the government can sue any person who uses dynamite or other explosive substance in any way (whether coastal or inland) with intent to catch or destroy any fish or poisonous fish in order to kill.</li>
            <li><strong>1956</strong> - The River Boards Act enables the states to enrol the central government in setting up an Advisory River Board to resolve issues in inter-state cooperation.</li>
            <li><strong>1970</strong> - The Merchant Shipping Act aims to deal with waste arising from ships along the coastal areas within a specified radius.</li>
            <li><strong>1974</strong> - The Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act establishes an institutional structure for preventing and abating water pollution. It establishes standards for water quality and effluent. Polluting industries must seek permission to discharge waste into effluent bodies. The CPCB (Central Pollution Control Board) was constituted under this act.</li>
            <img src="water act.jpg" alt="" style="height: 30%; width: 30%;">
            <li><strong>1977</strong> - The Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Cess Act provides for the levy and collection of cess or fees on water consuming industries and local authorities.</li>
            <li><strong>1978</strong> - The Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Cess Rules contains the standard definitions and indicate the kind of and location of meters that every consumer of water is required to affix.</li>
            <li><strong>1991</strong> - The Coastal Regulation Zone Notification puts regulations on various activities, including construction, are regulated. It gives some protection to the backwaters and estuaries.</li>

    <section id="water-sources" class="cl">
        <h2 style="text-align: center;">Water Sources</h2>
        <p>There are various types of water sources around the world, each playing a crucial role in sustaining life and ecosystems. These sources can be broadly categorized into surface water and groundwater.</p>
        <!-- Add more details and options as needed -->
        <h3><strong>Surface water</strong></h3>
        <ol style="color: white;">
            <li style="font-size: large;">River</li>
            <img src="Elwha_River_-_Humes_Ranch_Area2.jpg" alt="" style="border-radius: 10%; height: 30%; width: 30%;">
            <p>A river is a ribbon-like body of water that flows downhill from the force of gravity. A river can be wide and deep, or shallow enough for a person to wade across. A flowing body of water that is smaller than a river is called a stream, creek, or brook.</p>
            <li style="font-size: large;">ocean</li>
            <img src="ocean.jpg" alt="" style="height: 30%; width: 30%; border-radius: 10%">
            <p>An ocean is a large area of water between continents. Oceans are very big and they join smaller seas together. Oceans (or marine biomes) cover 72% of Earth. There are five main oceans: the Pacific Ocean, the Atlantic Ocean, the Indian Ocean, the Southern Ocean, and the Arctic Ocean.</p>
            <li>reservoir</li>
            <img src="reservoir.jpg" alt="" style="height: 30%; width: 30%; border-radius: 10%">
            <p>A reservoir is an artificial lake where water is stored. Most reservoirs are formed by constructing dams across rivers. A reservoir can also be formed from a natural lake whose outlet has been dammed to control the water level. The dam controls the amount of water that flows out of the reservoir.</p>
            <li>pond</li>
            <img src="f12-backyard-pond-ideas-v2.jpg" alt="" style="height: 30%; width: 30%; border-radius: 10%">
            <p>A pond is a small area of still, fresh water. It is different from a river or a stream because it does not have moving water and it differs from a lake because it has a small area and is no more than around 1.8m deep.</p>
            <li>lake</li>
            <img src="lake.jpg" alt="" style="height: 30%; width: 30%; border-radius: 10%">
            <p>A lake (from Latin: lacus) is a large body of water (larger and deeper than a pond) within a body of land. As a lake is separated from the ocean, it is not a sea. Some lakes are very big, and people in the past sometimes called them seas. Lakes do not flow like rivers, but many have rivers flowing into and out of them.</p>
            <li>glaciers</li>
            <img src="glacier.jpg" alt="" style="border-radius: 10%">
            <p>A glacier is a large, perennial accumulation of crystalline ice, snow, rock, sediment, and often liquid water that originates on land and moves down slope under the influence of its own weight and gravity.</p>
            <li>Swamp</li>
            <img src="louisiana-swamp.jpg" alt="" style="height: 30%; width: 30%; border-radius: 10%">
            <p>A swamp is a forested wetland. Swamps are considered to be transition zones because both land and water play a role in creating this environment. Swamps vary in size and are located all around the world. The water of a swamp may be fresh water, brackish water, or seawater.</p>
        </ol>
        <h3><strong>Groundwater</strong></h3>
        <p>Groundwater is the water present beneath Earth's surface in rock and soil pore spaces and in the fractures of rock formations. About 30 percent of all readily available freshwater in the world is groundwater. A unit of rock or an unconsolidated deposit is called an aquifer when it can yield a usable quantity of water.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Aquifer</li>
            <p>An aquifer is an underground layer of water-bearing, permeable rock, rock fractures, or unconsolidated materials. Groundwater from aquifers can be extracted using a water well. Water from aquifers can be sustainably harvested through the use of qanats. Aquifers vary greatly in their characteristics</p>
            <li>Artesian well</li>
            <p>An artesian well is a well that brings groundwater to the surface without pumping because it is under pressure within a body of rock and/or sediment known as an aquifer.[1] When trapped water in an aquifer is surrounded by layers of impermeable rock or clay, which apply positive pressure to the water, it is known as an artesian aquifer.</p>
            <li>Hand dug wells</li>
            <p>Hand-dug wells are ground excavations and their associated structures used to access groundwater in underground aquifers. Until modern times, all artificial wells were hand-dug. Interesting Facts. Hand-dug wells are still the most common means of collecting water in certain parts of the developing world.</p>

    <section id="water-cycle" class="cl">
        <h2 style="text-align: center;">Water cycle</h2>
        <img src="AXA-OOP-water-cycle-diagram.webp" alt="" style="height: 50%; border-radius: 10%; width: 50%; text-align: center; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto">
        <p>The water cycle shows the continuous movement of water within the Earth and atmosphere. It is a complex system that includes many different processes. Liquid water evaporates into water vapor, condenses to form clouds, and precipitates back to earth in the form of rain and snow.</p>
        <!-- Add more details and options as needed -->
        <h2>Steps in water-cycle are as follows:
        </h2>
        <ol>
            <li>evaporation</li>
            <p>The first step occurs when the sun's heat causes water from oceans, lakes, and rivers to turn into water vapor in the atmosphere.</p>
            <li>Condensation</li>
            <p>As the water vapor rises, it cools and changes back into tiny water droplets, forming clouds.</p>
            <li>precipitation</li>
            <p>When the cloud particles combine and grow heavy enough, they fall to the ground as precipitation—rain, snow, sleet, or hail.</p>
            <li>runoff</li>
            <p>After precipitation, water may run off surfaces, like rooftops or roads, into rivers, lakes, or oceans.</p>
            <li>infiltration</li>
            <p>Some precipitation soaks into the ground, replenishing groundwater and forming a part of the Earth's water reservoirs.</p>
            <li>Transpiration</li>
            <p>Plants absorb water from the soil through their roots and release it into the air as vapor through small openings in their leaves.</p>
